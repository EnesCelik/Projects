Battleship Web Game themed as Easter Egg Hunt
The goal of the game is to find all the missing easter eggs
This game can be played with a friend.

TBA: 
- There are plans of improving the Two Player logic. The code is not optimized due to time constraints. 
- There is commented code indicating that work is yet to be done regarding how the 2 Player game dynamic works. As the players get randomized eggs instead of placing them manually.
Will try to work on those in free time
